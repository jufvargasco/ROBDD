A package for working with Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (O\+B\+D\+Ds) is provided.

This package allows to reduce said data structures, obtaining equivalent R\+O\+B\+D\+Ds. In order to do so, the if-\/then-\/else (I\+TE) algorithm is used, together with the corresponding unique and computed tables.\hypertarget{index_used_sec}{}\section{Techniques and tools used}\label{index_used_sec}
This package has been implemented in C++ using C\+Lion as I\+DE. Also, this has been done using Test Driven Develpment (T\+DD), with the tests being implemented using Gtest. Finally, this documentation has been generated using Doxygen.\hypertarget{index_devs_sec}{}\section{Developers}\label{index_devs_sec}
